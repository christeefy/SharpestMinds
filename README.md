# SharpestMinds
A repository for SharpestMinds skills verification.

The project in this repo is on utilising transfer learning to perform image classification on the *notMNIST* dataset, which contains the English letters of 'A' to 'J' in various fonts.

Due to memory limitations, the model checkpoints and the bottleneck-encoded *notMNIST* file can be accessed through this [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/brolhraem0mc3wy/AADGkj4z7emlcVwPmsmUiXcJa?dl=0).
